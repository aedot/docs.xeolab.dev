### Export Drive

- Export drive
```
RCLONE_DRIVE="Gdrive"
```
- Verify Gdrive was created
```
rclone listremotes
```
??? info

    There should be Gdrive, if not youâ€™ll need to start the rclone config process again as something has gone wrong.

- list rclone directory
```
rclone lsd "$RCLONE_DRIVE":
```
- There should be no files showing.
- Choose a folder to copy the backup files to 
```
export RCLONE_PATH="Backup"
```
- Make a folder in Google Drive with folder name
```
rclone mkdir "$RCLONE_DRIVE:Backup"
```
- Check if folder was created
```
rclone lsd "$RCLONE_DRIVE":
```
- This step might not be needed for our purposes, but I ran it just in case: 
```
export ARCHIVE_SYSTEM=rclone
```

### Create Script for Autobackup
- Staying in the sudo -i session
- Navigate to the folder where backup is store
- Create a script in the folder
```
nano backup.sh
```
